# 🚍 Data Analytics Project – SRTU Dataset (Excel Dashboard)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **State Road Transport Undertakings (SRTUs)** data using **Excel**.  
The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and visualized into a **dashboard** that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, and staff utilization.

## 🛠 Steps Performed  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed unnecessary fields that did not add analytical value.  
   - Standardized text formatting (case, spaces).  
   - Eliminated duplicates and blank values.  
   - Converted negative values into positive using ABS() for consistent reporting.  

2. **Formulas & Functions Used** *(short descriptions only)*  
   - **Text Functions** → To clean and standardize names.  
   - **Logical Functions** → Categorized SRTUs into **regions (North, South, East, West, Central)**.  
   - **Math Functions** → Calculated Profit %, Cost per Km, and Revenue per Km.  
   - **Conditional Checks** → To group and filter data dynamically.  
   - **Count Functions** → Counted SRTUs excluding headers.  

3. **KPIs Calculated**  
   - **Total Revenue** – Overall revenue from all SRTUs.  
   - **Total Profit** – Aggregated net profit.  
   - **Revenue per SRTU** – Revenue distribution per transport unit.  
   - **Profit/Loss % per SRTU** – Performance indicator for each SRTU.  
   - **Total Staff** – Workforce strength across SRTUs.  
   - **No. of SRTUs** – Count of unique transport undertakings.  

4. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Used **Pivot Tables** to aggregate KPIs.  
   - Designed **charts (column, pie, line)** for visual storytelling.  
   - Added **interactive KPIs & text boxes** to highlight results.
